## Scientific Overview

The optimization of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) processing parameters is frequently constrained by the extensive experimental overhead required to identify stable melting regimes. This framework provides a predictive analytical solution to estimate melt pool morphology and evaluate manufacturing stability. By coupling classical thermal models with established defect criteria, the tool delineates "Safe Zones" from regions prone to balling, lack of fusion (LoF), and keyhole-induced porosity.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the core dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilidio-costa/L-PBF-Processing-Maps-Predictive-Analytical-Modelling.git
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
## Theoretical Framework

### Thermal Modeling Strategy

To capture the complex heat transfer regimes in L-PBF, the engine employs a hybrid modeling approach:
- **Conduction Mode (Eagar-Tsai Model):** Utilizes a traveling Gaussian-distributed heat source on a semi-infinite substrate to predict surface dimensions ($W$ and $L$) .
- **Deep Penetration Mode (Gladush-Smurov Model):** Accounts for keyhole physics by treating the laser as a cylindrical heat source, providing accurate depth ($D$) predictions in high-intensity regimes .
- **Dimensionless Scaling (Rubenchik Model):** Normalizes spatial coordinates and thermal variables to determine melt pool dimensions via universal functions ($g$) and normalized enthalpy ($B$) .


### Defect Evaluation Criteria

The printability of a specific parameter set is defined by the simultaneous avoidance of multiple competing defect regimes. Each analytical criterion is encapsulated within an isolated Python module in the `src/defects/` directory and adheres to a standardized API. This modularity allows the framework to evaluate each physical instability independently while maintaining a unified hierarchical logic for final visualization.

The table below details the current defect modules, their underlying analytical models, and the mathematical conditions they evaluate:

### Algorithmic Implementation of Defect Criteria
| Defect Type | Analytical Model | Python Module | Defect Condition (Returns `True`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Balling** | Plateau-Rayleigh | `ball01.py` | $L/W \ge 2.3$ |
| **Balling** | Yadroitsev Stability | `ball02.py` | $\frac{\pi W}{L} \le \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ |
| **Lack of Fusion** | Depth-to-Layer Ratio | `lof01.py` | $D \le t$  |
| **Lack of Fusion** | Geometric Overlap | `lof02.py` | $(\frac{h}{W})^2 + \frac{t}{t+D} \ge 1.0$  |
| **Lack of Fusion** | Depth-to-Layer Ratio | `lof03.py` | $D/t > 1.5$  |
| **Keyholing** | King Keyhole Criteria | `key01.py` | $A \cdot P > \pi \rho C_p T_m \sqrt{\alpha v a^3} \cdot \frac{\pi T_b}{T_m}$  |
| **Keyholing** | Geometric Ratio | `key02.py` | $W/D < 2.0$  |
| **Keyholing** | Geometric Ratio | `key03.py` | $W/D < 1.5$  |
| **Keyholing** | Geometric Ratio | `key04.py` | $W/D < 2.75$  |
| **Keyholing** | Gan Keyhole Criteria | `key05.py` | $Ke = \frac{A \cdot P}{(T_m - T_0) \pi \rho C_p \sqrt{\alpha v a^3}} > 6.0$ |

### Modular API and Priority Mapping
Each defect module uses a standardized function signature: `def check(dimensions, process_parameters, material) -> bool`. This enables the core physics engine to:
* **Perform Isolated Evaluations**: Individual boundaries can be verified independently to confirm specific mathematical thresholds without interference from overlapping regimes.
* **Route Defect Priority**: In regions where multiple conditions are met, a priority-routing algorithm determines the dominant mechanism for visualization in the printability map.
* **Integrate Uncertainty**: Results can be normalized into model probabilities using a softmax function, identifying regions where predictive uncertainty is high (e.g., when models yield conflicting results).


## Repository Architecture & API Reference

The project follows a modular architecture ensuring a strict separation of concerns between physics, data management, and visualization.

### Physics Engine (`src/physics.py`)

### Material Management (`src/data_loader.py`)
* **`load_material`**: Parses JSON files to calculate derived properties like thermal diffusivity ($\alpha = k / (\rho C_p)$).

### Material JSON Structure
To ensure physical accuracy, thermophysical properties (Density, Specific Heat, and Thermal Conductivity) should be extracted at or near the material's melting point. Material files in the `materials/` directory follow this structure:

```json

    "rho": 6100,
    "C_p": 510,
    "k": 4.4,
    "T_b": 3033,
    "T_m": 1583,
    "A": 0.32,
    "alpha": 8e-6,
    "electrical_resistivity": 8.2e-7
}
